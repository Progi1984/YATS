This library is a PHP C extension that provides templating facilities. This
allows the web developer to cleanly separate php code (logic) from html (display).

Key benefits of using this extension as compared to other php templating 
solutions are:

1) speed.  

Because it is in C, it is typically faster than implementations written in php.

2) ease of use

Both the php API and the templating syntax are quite simple.

3) flexible, yet not a complete language.

the templating syntax provides support for simple implicit loops and nested sections,
allowing the web developer to control things to a very fine degree.  However, there 
are no real conditional expressions or other logical constructs. There is no support
for embedding php code within a template, now will there ever be as it violates the
model.  There is no danger of this becoming another "language within a language".



Various iterations of this code have been/are running at 
Epinions.com and are sufficiently fast for the high traffic volume this 
site encounters, with dozens of templates being processed during each 
http request.  No specific speed claims are made.  Your mileage may vary.

Sample php scripts are in ./sample.  The best/quickest way to learn
how to use the library is just to view the source to these and load 
them in your browser

It is the author's hope that this code will be found useful by someone, 
and would like to hear about how and where it is being used, or 
suggestions for improvement.
